Due to technical issue with hosting Unity projects via GitHub Page, We (Team Kaiyo) is using RENDER.COM to host our Unity project.

The server framework is made by Ratul Hasan [RaSan147/pyrobox](https://github.com/RaSan147/pyrobox)

Due to the large size of the project, we are unable to publish the project source code on GitHub.
